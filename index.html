    <div class="mt-5">
      <h5>Understanding the Columns</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ShopID</strong>: A unique identifier from the company’s internal system. Use this ID to cross‑reference the shop in other databases.</li>
        <li><strong>AccountName</strong>: The full name of the pizzeria as it appears in your records. This is the store name you’ll mention in outreach.</li>
        <li><strong>BillingCity</strong> &amp; <strong>BillingZip</strong>: The city and ZIP code where the shop operates. These help you confirm you’re targeting the right location.</li>
        <li><strong>Website</strong>: The URL of the shop’s own website, if one exists. Blank values indicate the business does not have a site listed.</li>
        <li><strong>HasWebsite</strong>: <em>True</em> if Google Places returned a website for the shop; otherwise <em>False</em>. Shops without a site are prime candidates for Slice’s website package.</li>
        <li><strong>DirectOrdering</strong>: <em>True</em> when the shop’s website offers its own ordering (not just links to DoorDash/GrubHub). If <em>False</em>, the business relies solely on third‑party apps and may benefit from Slice’s integrated ordering and POS.</li>
        <li><strong>Note</strong>: Additional context explaining why a shop is flagged—e.g., “No website” or “Third‑party only.” Use this field to tailor your outreach.</li>
      </ul>
